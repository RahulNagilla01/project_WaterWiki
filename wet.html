        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Water efficiency is about reducing water wastage by measuring the amount of water required for a particular purpose and the amount used or delivered. Techniques and technologies have been developed to achieve water efficiency, which is crucial for sustainable development, especially in areas facing water scarcity.</p>
        
        <h2>Techniques for Water Efficiency</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Rainwater Harvesting</h3>
        <img src="https://sacleanwater.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rainwater-Harvesting-How-does-it-work.png" alt="Rainwater Harvesting">
        <p>Rainwater harvesting is the collection and storage of rainwater for reuse on-site, rather than allowing it to run off. This water can be used for various purposes, such as irrigation, flushing toilets, and even drinking, if properly treated.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Drip Irrigation</h3>
        <img src="https://driptips.toro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Drip-System-English_130311.jpg" alt="Drip Irrigation System">
        <p>Drip irrigation systems deliver water directly to the base of the plant, reducing evaporation and runoff. This method is highly efficient and can reduce water usage by 30-70% compared to conventional irrigation methods.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Xeriscaping</h3>

        <p>Xeriscaping is a landscaping method that reduces the need for irrigation by using drought-tolerant plants and efficient watering practices. This technique is particularly effective in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Greywater Recycling</h3>

        <p>Greywater recycling involves reusing water from baths, sinks, and washing machines for purposes such as irrigation or toilet flushing. This reduces the demand for fresh water and minimizes wastewater discharge.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Leak Detection and Repair</h3>
        <img src="https://pipeserv.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/5b0a5802-8986-4614-83ad-8e114fb8501f-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Leak Detection and Repair">
        <p>Regularly checking for and repairing leaks in plumbing systems can prevent significant water loss. Even small leaks can waste large amounts of water over time, making this a critical aspect of water efficiency.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Implementing water-efficient techniques is essential for conserving water resources and ensuring their availability for future generations. By adopting these practices, individuals and communities can contribute to sustainable water management.</p>
